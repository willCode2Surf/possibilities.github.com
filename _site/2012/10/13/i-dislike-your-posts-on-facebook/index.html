<p>Facebook is so trashy these days. And I&#8217;m not talking about the corporation. They were already pretty trashy by the time I joined in 2008 so that&#8217;s nothing new. It&#8217;s the manner in which people that I know, love and respect <em>use facebook</em> that make&#8217;s me want to take a shower whenever I see their posts.</p>

<p>Again, if I see you doing these things I love and/or respect you but I die a little every time:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Complaints about Facebook trying to make money. This usually comes up when someone has a Facebook fan page and they&#8217;re mad that they&#8217;re being extorted to pay if they want more than x percent of their fans to see their posts. Everyone involved (including me) got into bed with this advertising company&#8217;s free app and now we&#8217;re surprised that they want to monetize? I&#8217;d SO much rather they charge people and companies to promote their content than almost every other option.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Text superimposed on images and &#8220;bumper sticker logic&#8221;. OK, I get it someone who knows someone you know (or someone on reddit) took the time to open up photoshop and type something witty over a powerful image but really&#8230; is this the way we communicate now? I&#8217;d be more interested in a less powerful message that you took the time to think through and type into the little box at the top of your feed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Spotify and all other &#8220;frictionless sharing&#8221;. Automatic sharing is uninteresting. It&#8217;s sharing without all the trouble of deciding what you want to share. As soon as I am able to know every song/album you listen to I immediately don&#8217;t care. If you get excited about music and take the time to type about it I automatically care.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A close cousin of the previous &#8220;peeve&#8221; is when people post links from inside apps that then require me to add the app to access the content of the link. That&#8217;s just annoying. Don&#8217;t prop up these sleazy marketing machines by using their sleazy apps!</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Links to songs on YouTube that are not videos. There&#8217;s actually no fundamentally better place to link to but I&#8217;d rather see a link into a walled garden like Grooveshark where I can play the song in a respectable player than see a YouTube link that shows some still image with the song playing in the background. This is more a failure of the internet at large that we haven&#8217;t figured out a way to have a canonical link to a song or album. So yes, I&#8217;m being a big baby here but that doesn&#8217;t stop it from annoying me.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>OK, now it&#8217;s your chance to tell me how much you dislike my posts if you haven&#8217;t already gotten around to unsubscribing from them. Thanks, I look forward to your vitriol (:</p>
