<p>Yup, here I go again&#8230; I&#8217;ve started and quit blogging just about every year for 5-6 years. I&#8217;m back because I like to write and life fills with more interesting things to write about every day. I think my past blogging failures have always been due to the fact that I start off with one epic piece (or three) and never feel satisfied that the next piece is epic enough to play on the same page as the previous ones.</p>

<p>The solution: write more often about smaller less lofty things and don&#8217;t worry about sounding smart. The end.</p>

<p>P.s. I&#8217;m using Jekyll because it&#8217;s awesome and at some point I might make things look nicer&#8230; but for now it&#8217;s all about taking action!</p>
