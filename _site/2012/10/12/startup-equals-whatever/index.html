<p>I&#8217;ve been working for &#8220;startups&#8221; for a few years now. I live in Maine where there are close to zero startups &#185;. I only know of <a href='http://librarything.com'>LibraryThing</a>&#8230; 1 is pretty close to 0, no? Interestingly no one has ever asked me what a startup is. I&#8217;m unsure if it&#8217;s because they a) don&#8217;t care, b) are afraid to ask or c) have their own idea about what it means (please tell me)Â¿ Regardless, some time in the last few weeks I started asking this question myself. The example case I&#8217;ve been fixated on is Github. Obviously they were a startup at one point but now with a proven business model and giant pile of VC money are they still a startup!? Then synchronicity stuck when Paul Graham popped up with his, now seminal, <a href='http://jmlite.tumblr.com/post/33443330774/startup-idea'>piece on this topic</a> and yesterday <a href='http://jmlite.tumblr.com/post/33443330774/startup-idea'>another thoughtful rant</a> hit HackerNews. Both of these guys are very smart so I as I started reading each article I assumed I&#8217;d have a clearcut answer to my question&#8230;</p>

<p>My conclusion: It doesn&#8217;t matter and I won&#8217;t be using the term anymore. The end.</p>
