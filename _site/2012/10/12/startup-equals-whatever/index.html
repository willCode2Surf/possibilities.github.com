<h2 id='startup__whatever'>Startup = Whatever</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working for &#8220;startups&#8221; for a few years now. I live in Maine (until the end of this month when I&#8217;ll be moving to SF, i.e. <em>Startup-town USA</em>) where there are close to zero startups (I only know of <a href='http://librarything.com'>LibraryThing</a>&#8230; 1 is pretty close to 0, no?). Interestingly no one has ever asked me what a startup is. I&#8217;m unsure if it&#8217;s because they a) don&#8217;t care, b) are afraid to ask or c) have their own idea about what it means (please tell me)Â¿ Regardless, some time in the last few weeks I started asking this question myself. The example case I&#8217;ve been fixated on is Github. Obviously they were a startup at one point but now with a proven business model and giant pile of VC money are they still a startup!? In another great example of synchronicity Paul Graham popped up with his, now seminal, <a href='http://jmlite.tumblr.com/post/33443330774/startup-idea'>piece on this topic</a> and a yesterday <a href='http://jmlite.tumblr.com/post/33443330774/startup-idea'>another thoughtful rant</a> hit HackerNews. Both of these guys are very smart and as I began to read each article I assumed the end result would lead me to a clearcut answer to my question&#8230;</p>

<p>My conclusion: it doesn&#8217;t matter and I won&#8217;t be using the term anymore. The end.</p>
