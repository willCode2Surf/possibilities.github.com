## {{ page.title }}

Facebook is so trashy these days. And I'm not talking about the corporation. They were already pretty trashy by the time I joined in 2008 so that's nothing new. It's the manner in which people that I know, love and respect *use facebook* that make's me want to take a shower whenever I see their posts.

Again, if I see you doing these things I love and/or respect you but I die a little every time:

1. Complaints about Facebook trying to make money. This usually comes up when someone has a Facebook page and they're mad that they're being extorted to pay if they want more than x percent of their fans to see their posts. Everyone involved (including me) got into bed with this advertising company's free app and now we're surprised that they want to monetize? I'd SO much rather they charge people and companies to promote their content than almost every other option.

2. Text superimposed on images and "bumper sticker logic". OK, I get it someone who knows someone you know (or someone on reddit) took the time to open up photoshop and type something witty over a powerful image but really... is this the way we communicate now? I'd be more interested in a less powerful message that you took the time to think through and type into the little box at the top of your feed.

3. Spotify and all other "frictionless sharing". Automatic sharing is uninteresting. It's sharing without all the trouble of deciding what you want to share. As soon as I am able to know every song/album you listen to I immediately don't care. If you get excited about music and take the time to type about it I automatically care.

4. A close cousin of the previous "peeve" is when people post links from inside apps that then require me to add the app to access the content of the link. That's just annoying. Don't prop up these sleazy marketing machines by using their sleazy apps!

5. Links to songs on YouTube that are not videos. There's actually no fundamentally better place to link to but I'd rather see a link into a walled garden like Grooveshark where I can play the song in a respectable player than see a YouTube link that shows some still image with the song playing in the background. This is more a failure of the internet at large that we haven't figured out a way to have a canonical link to a song or album. So yes, I'm being a big baby here but that doesn't stop it from annoying me.

OK, now it's your chance to tell me how much you dislike my posts if you haven't already gotten around to unsubscribing from them. Thanks, I look forward to your vitriol (:
