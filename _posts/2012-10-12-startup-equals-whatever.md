## {{ page.title }}

I've been working for "startups" for a few years now. I live in Maine where there are close to zero startups &sup1;. I only know of [LibraryThing](http://librarything.com)... 1 is pretty close to 0, no? Interestingly no one has ever asked me what a startup is. I'm unsure if it's because they a) don't care, b) are afraid to ask or c) have their own idea about what it means (please tell me)Â¿ Regardless, some time in the last few weeks I started asking this question myself. The example case I've been fixated on is Github. Obviously they were a startup at one point but now with a proven business model and giant pile of VC money are they still a startup!? Then synchronicity stuck when Paul Graham popped up with his, now seminal, [piece on this topic](http://jmlite.tumblr.com/post/33443330774/startup-idea) and yesterday [another thoughtful rant](http://jmlite.tumblr.com/post/33443330774/startup-idea) hit HackerNews. Both of these guys are very smart so I as I started reading each article I assumed I'd have a clearcut answer to my question...

My conclusion: It doesn't matter and I won't be using the term anymore. The end.
