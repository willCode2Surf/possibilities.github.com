## {{ page.title }}

I've been working for "startups" for a few years now. I live in Maine where there are close to zero startups &sup1;. I only know of [LibraryThing](http://librarything.com)... 1 is pretty close to 0, no? Interestingly no one has ever asked me what a startup is. I'm unsure if it's because they a) don't care, b) are afraid to ask or c) have their own idea about what it means (please tell me)¿ Regardless, some time in the last few weeks I started asking this question myself. The example case I've been fixated on is Github. Obviously they were a startup at one point but now with a proven business model and giant pile of VC money are they still a startup!? Then synchronicity stuck when Paul Graham popped up with his, now seminal, [piece on this topic](http://paulgraham.com/growth.html) and yesterday [another thoughtful rant](http://jmlite.tumblr.com/post/33443330774/startup-idea) hit HackerNews. Both of these guys are very smart so as I started reading each article I assumed I'd finish with clearcut answer to my question... but that's not really where I landed. Ends up, IMHO, being a kind of weak term without a definition that will ever satisfy everyone. 

My conclusion: It doesn't matter enough to worry about and I won't be using the term anymore. The end.
