Yup, here I go again... I've started and quit blogging just about every year for 5-6 years. I'm back because I like to write and life fills with more interesting things to write about every day. I think my past blogging failures have always been due to the fact that I start off with one epic piece (or three) and never feel satisfied that the next piece is epic enough to play on the same page as the previous ones.

The solution: write more often about smaller less lofty things and don't worry about sounding smart. The end.

P.s. I'm using Jekyll because it's awesome and at some point I might make things look nicer... but for now it's all about taking action!
